# secure-webapp-ci-demo

This project demonstrates a secure CI/CD pipeline for a Python web application 
using GitHub Actions. 

Security tools like **Bandit** and **Safety** are integrated to automatically 
detect insecure code patterns and known vulnerabilities in dependencies.



##** Vulnerability Management**

Safety detected a known vulnerability in Flask (CVE-2025-47278).  
The package was upgraded to version 3.1.1 to resolve the issue.  
This demonstrates proactive security scanning and remediation in CI/CD.
